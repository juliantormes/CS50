If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018,
how would you characterize their audio aura?

    +-------------+--------------+-------------------+
    | AVG(energy) | AVG(valence) | AVG(danceability) |
    +-------------+--------------+-------------------+
    | 0.65906     | 0.484443     | 0.71646           |
    +-------------+--------------+-------------------+

    Based on the previous query result, we can say that
    the audio aura of the listener has high energy (0.65906), high danceability (0.71646),
    and low valence (0.484443).

    Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might
    not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of
    calculating this aura would you propose?

    We can improve the computation of the audio aura by
    taking into account factors such as the times each song is reproduce,
    the tempo, and the instrumentation or the genre of the song. This will help to
    the calculation and create a more accurate and personalized audio aura.
