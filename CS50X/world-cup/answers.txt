Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
The teams with the lowest rating significantly dropped the chances as the number of predictions goes up
Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
I think going with 100 is already good enough but to make sure i will go with 1000, that is only 4s more
